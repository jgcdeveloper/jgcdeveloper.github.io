My name is Jason Clegg! I am 34 years of age, come from the Northern reaches of Canada, and have decided to switch careers and move towards working as a Software Developer. What brought me to this place at this stage of my life? Here is my story. 

Growing up I loved computers, and while not quite as handy with them as the Woz, I did know my way around a command prompt. I remember digging through configuration files trying to free up main and extended memory to try and get some new program or game working. I also recall more then a few times I thought I had moved one DIP switch too many, and had crashed my computer for good, only to get it working right at the last moment.

Ok, so maybe I was not building the things from the circuit board level up, but my parents were farmers, I lived in a rural community of 3500 people, and playing around with computers was still not the cool thing to do. Overall, I think I did pretty good!

This was not just a passing phase either. Even through high school, I intended to pursue a career working with Electronics and Computers. I took Electronics Engineering Technology in college and upon graduation was hoping to move right into the field. I did good at college (although where I went is perhaps a great regret in my life), graduated near the top of my class, and was looking forward into starting life as a working man.

Unfortunately, I finished my program at the tail end of the dot-com boom. Nortel, Canada's biggest electronics firm at the time, was a mess and laying all sorts of people off, creating a flood of workers on the market. So, with work dried up in the normal avenues, I ended up taking work where I could find it, which were the Canadian oilfields. Now, I didn't start as a labourer by any means. Instead I started as an electronics technician fixing equipment. Soon, I ended up moving into operations, where I made my professional life for 13 years.

However, that door is closing, partially with my help. I have decided to move back into the field of computers, which is where I feel my natural abilities lie. However, instead of focusing on hardware, I have decided to move into the wonderful world of coding! Being rather impatient however, I decided I didn't want to sit in a school for another 2 or 4 years, so I decided to try through boot camps. After much hand wringing, I decided that the best option for me would be an online course. That brought me to Bloc.io. After discussions with them, I decided to commit to the program, and in August 2016 I began the Software Developer track training program.

I am only learning, but I am picking it up quickly. My mind works in a logical manner, and this really helps to learn the ebbs and flows of code. I hope to use this website to share what I have done, what I have learned, and what I find interesting. Maybe you are even considering me for a position as a developer with your company. Whatever your reason here, I bid you welcome, and hope you find this little peek into my mind interesting!
