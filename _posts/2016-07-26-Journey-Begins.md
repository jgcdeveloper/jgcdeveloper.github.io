Well, this is it. The start of my blog to document my progress in journey to becoming a software developer.

I would like to welcome anyone that may have stumbled upon this blog. To be honest, at this point I am not really targeting this at the general public. Rather, this is for myself, my mentor, and hopefully potential employers to act as a personal log of what I am learning as I go through the Bloc program.

I am going to make an effort to update it as much as time allows to give insight into what I am learning. There is a lot to learn, and I am trying to continue on with a normal life outside of the program.

I must say I am looking forward to the journey!
