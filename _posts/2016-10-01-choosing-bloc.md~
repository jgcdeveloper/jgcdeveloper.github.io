So, I am now about six weeks into the Bloc program and so far things have been going pretty well.

I feel I am starting to get a pretty good grasp of the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. We have even touched upon a little bit of jQuery. 

My sense of accomplishment is tempered by the fact that I know there is so much more to learn with all these languages, and all the others out there. I often find myself looking for help on a particularly tough problem on the internet, and when I find some blog post or forum posting with a solution, I once again fully appreciate the complexity of these systems. Even closer to home, all it takes is one high level kyu in Codewars to knock me on my ass to remind me that there is still a whole lot more to learn.

At the same time, I need to tell myself that I can't be expected to know the same amount as someone who has been working with these languages professionally for years. Experience counts for so much. When I look at where I was even a month ago and compare it to now, I see a lot of progress and understanding about what I can do with these languages.

The thing is, I look forward to the challenge of learning more. I am not content to just surf and find plug-and-play solutions. Rather, I want to be the one writing the answers, giving the advice, and even writing the code.

This is my goal going forward with the Bloc program.
