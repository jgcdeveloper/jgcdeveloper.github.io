Part of re-entering the ranks of job-hunters is considering how things have changed since the last time I was in this position. 

I was with my old company for over 10 years. That's a good chunk of my adult life. There is lots to consider when one changes paths at this stage in their life. This post isn't about that.

Instead, this is about a little thing called social media. When I got my last job in 2005, the internet was still around and a big part of everyday life, but still the amount people were using it barely scratched the surface of how we use in today in 2016.

For most people, this takes the form of social media. Facebook, Twitter, InstaGram are some of the biggest websites out there today. Their parent companies are some of the biggest in the world, or at least the most influencial. 

You probably know this. I know this. What I am not sure about is how exactly this relates to the modern job hunting process.

You see, I am not very active on social media. I have a Facebook and Instagram account of course, and I follow many on Twitter (even if I don't tweet myself). I do not, however, post photos or commentary every day. To be honest, I just don't have it in me to do so. Although I am from the generation that is first on the cusp of the social media explosion, for me it is not a major part of my life.

Will they suspect I am a tech luddite, not fit to surf the waves of the internet ( side note: we don't really say surf the web anymore...do we? ). Perhaps they will think I am hiding a past I don't want to reveal.

No, instead it is just that I have decided not to share every moment of my life with everybody else.

I asked around with people in the career board of the Bloc program, and they said that they do not think this will hurt me unless I am applying for designer/UI/UX type jobs on social media websites/platforms. I don't think this is a worry, because
